# Hertz_HighThroughput_Riboswitch_Discovery_2025

This repository contains the computational pipelines used in the study of high-throughput fluoride riboswitch discovery. It consists of two major components:

### 🔬 Bioinformatics_Covariation  
Contains all materials required to reproduce the covariation analysis of the fluoride riboswitch using R-scape and associated tools.

### 🧬 RNA-seq  
Contains all materials required to reproduce the RNA-seq analysis of 1,901 fluoride riboswitch variants, including read mapping, quantification, and termination assessment.
