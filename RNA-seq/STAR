Additional explination of STAR and the chosen parameters is further explained by giving the following prompt to ChatGPT:

Please explain the following:

The reads were aligned to their accession number and genome positions using STAR (v2.7.9a) (PMID: 23104886). STAR was run with the following specified parameters: 
STAR --runMode alignReads \ 
--alignIntronMax 1 \
--genomDir /path/ \
--readFilesIn Folder/path/.fastq \
--outFileNamePrefix Folder/name_ \
--alignEndsType Local \
--alignSoftClipAtReferenceEnds Yes \
--outFilterScoreMinOverLread 0.5 \
--outFilterMatchNminOverLread 0.5 \
--outSAMmultNmax 1

ChatGPT gave the following response:
STAR (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference): STAR is a software tool used for aligning RNA-seq reads to a reference genome. It is specifically designed for speed and accuracy, making it widely used in transcriptomics.  Version: STAR v2.7.9a (PMID: 23104886) refers to a specific version of the STAR aligner, cited in a related paper.

--runMode alignReads: Specifies the mode of operation for STAR. In this case, it is aligning reads to a reference genome.
--alignIntronMax 1: Sets the maximum intron size for spliced alignments. In this case, introns longer than 1 base will not be considered during the alignment process. This is typically used in certain situations where you expect no or very small introns. [LMH: no introns]
--genomDir /path/: Specifies the path to the directory containing the reference genome index that STAR will use for alignment.
--readFilesIn Folder/path/.fastq: Specifies the input RNA-seq data files. Here, .fastq files containing the reads are provided as input for alignment.
--outFileNamePrefix Folder/name_: Sets the prefix for all output files generated by STAR. For example, STAR will produce files like name_Aligned.out.sam or name_Log.out. 
--alignEndsType Local: This parameter specifies how STAR will handle the alignment of the read ends. With Local, STAR will perform local alignment, which allows for the alignment of fragments that may not align perfectly across the entire length (e.g., when the read spans an exon-exon junction). [LMH: i.e. or terminated reads]
--alignSoftClipAtReferenceEnds Yes: If this is set to "Yes", STAR will allow soft-clipping (trimming of bases at the ends of the read) at the reference genome ends. This is useful for aligning reads where part of the read may be unaligned at the ends, often seen in RNA-seq due to partial or incomplete transcript coverage. [LMH: i.e. or terminated reads]
--outFilterScoreMinOverLread 0.5: This filter ensures that only reads with a score (based on the alignment quality) of at least 50% of the read length are kept. Essentially, it keeps alignments where the quality of the match is sufficiently good. [LMH: prevent read filtering of terminated reads]
--outFilterMatchNminOverLread 0.5: This sets the minimum fraction of matched bases over the read length to 50%. In other words, the read must have at least 50% of its bases matching the reference genome to pass the filter. [LMH: prevent read read filtering of terminated reads]
--outSAMmultNmax 1: This parameter limits the number of alignments allowed for each read. If the read has more than one valid alignment, STAR will only keep the first one. This can reduce the number of ambiguous or multi-mapped reads in the output. [LMH: prevent read assignment to multiple variants]
Purpose of the Parameters: These parameters aim to fine-tune how the reads are aligned, focusing on high-quality, reliable matches. Filters on scores and base matches help reduce errors or noise from low-quality reads. 
The use of alignEndsType Local and alignSoftClipAtReferenceEnds Yes optimizes STAR's handling of RNA-seq data, where splicing and soft-clipping are common due to exon-exon junctions or partially captured transcripts. By running STAR with these specific parameters, you ensure that only high-quality and well-aligned reads are used for downstream analyses, like transcript quantification or variant calling.
